                  Thanks for checking out my Portfolio. In large part these projects express my interests and personality. 
                  
                  I have to create and I have to learn and I have to be challenged — I’m thorough and I won’t stop until it’s great. 
                  
                  I’m a mom, a sister, a friend and I have a zeal for life as an adventure. My boys call it a spark when they see me go for something and accomplish it and If you want to do something spontaneous…I’m right there with you.
                  
                  Learning to code and making great websites is hard. You remember what I said about challenge. I bring many years, more than I care to say, and a wealth of experiences from extensive travel, teaching, music, photography, fine art and design. I see things through a different lens and bring that to the page with tenacity.
                  
                  My Capstone project features my original work, please check it out and reach out if I can help bring you or your team’s ideas to life.
